# hackMIT22 Project - MusicNotes
## Project Vision
Our project, MusicNotes, designs a journal app that is integrated with the Spotify API. Users use the app as a daily journal, searching for and listening to a song that they feel represents their current mood. They can then journal while listening to the song and save their response when they are done. Users can read their past entries and even analyze their past data.

Less than half of Gen-Z are satisfied with their mental health and have trouble expressing how they feel or making time to practice self-care. 90% of these surveyed potential users stated the music they listen to reflects their mood. 

MusicNotes is where music meets journing, making mental health more accessible. Turn up songs that express how you are feeling and describe how it relates to your life. Users document their emotional health through selecting songs that fit their mood and optionally writing description. Data visualizations will be generated from past entries to identify patterns, relating to mental state. A key intended feature of our application is the therapist tracker, which enables users to take action on their mental health journal. MusicNotes history can easily be shared with therapists to help them better understand treating their clients.

Our team of developers utilized Spotify for Developers in React.js and Python on the backend and Flask to integrate the two. Additionally, user input fuels our algorithm.

Key players in the journaling industry include Day One, Daylio, and Cozi. These applications provide a platform to log daily habits and emotions. MusicNotes differentiates with three benefits: music integration, self reflection, and therapist connections. Finally, with more time and money, we would set up a server for our database instead of hosting it locally.

## Next Steps
We had some trouble integrating the Spotify API on the frontend, so more work will definitely be needed there. Additionally, something fun to consider would be user privacy, especially if this project is being used in the context of medicine or therapy. Overall, we had a great time working on our first hackathon project :)
